# Portfolio-Update
Revamp of my portolio as of roughly one month into the UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp

Having now completed a number of homework assignments as well as learning a substantial amount of skills during in class activites, it is time to create a more flushed out and professional looking version of the portfolio that we created near the outset of the course. Inside this updated portfolio I will be including links to several of the homework assignments that I feel proud of as well as a link to our first group project which I collaborated on with several of my classmates.
