            <br><br>
            
            The Kebab Shop, San Diego CA<br>
            Corporate Partner, Regional Manager, Store Manager, …Line cook 	(09/2007)-(11/2017)
            <br><br>
                  Took a line cook job after moving to CA in 2007 to pay the rent, but after about a month I found myself managing the first location for the original owner of The Kebab Shop. He sold the restaurant and the concept to a pair of investors from real estate, Tony and AJ, who became my new bosses in 2008. They kept me on as manager and, somewhat surprisingly, trained under me to learn the details of the business before switching their focus to working on expanding the small shop into a chain of successful restaurants across San Diego county. Over the years I worked hand in hand with the growing corporate team to develop concepts both in and out of the kitchen to increase business, keep operations smooth, and find ways to continue growing our family to properly staff the thriving business. 
                  <br><br>
                I personally trained several hundred employees during my time with TKS to become capable workers in any hospitality or food handling setting, as we prided ourselves on giving team members a chance to grow their skill sets in a really broad way. I had the pleasure of promoting a number of store managers, many of whom came on as standard team members and then worked with myself and others over the years until we had another location up and running for them to step in as a leader for their own team. 
                <br><br>
               There were plenty of years of working long hours in the kitchen, but eventually I was fortunate enough to make my way into the office and spend more of my time focusing on how we can keep the restaurants great while continuing to expand and entrusting daily operations to the many team members I had helped develop and implanted into our 8 operating locations. In my time with TKS I gained a tremendous amount of experience in various aspects of leadership in a workplace as well as handling guest relations both in person and through digital formats. I helped handle everything from basic construction and plumbing at locations to helping keep their IT supported to ensure each shop had properly functioning POS systems and office equipment to help their in store management do their job properly. 
               <br><br>
              My job descriptions were so varied at TKS that I could ramble on for some time (HR, insurance claims, you name it), but as a partner my main responsibilities were to keep in touch with and oversee operations for a number of the locations directly, as well as being a contact point for any of our other store managers that needed help with anything at all. I was required to submit reports several times throughout the month for each of my locations. I also took over handling all responses to guests reaching out to us for all of our locations, many of which came through as phone calls to shops directly and then were redirected to me by store managers if they felt unable or uncomfortable responding, or email inputs that were forwarded to me and also responding to guests directly for all reviews and feedback received on the number of platforms we were using at that time (Largely Square, Yelp and Google Maps).

            Turners Seafood Grill & Market, Melrose MA<br>
            Expediter, Line Cook	(05/2005)-(07/2007)<br><br>
            
                  Started on at Turner’s as an expediter for the kitchen. I would mirror the lead cook on the line organizing a double print of the order tickets to ensure no orders took too long, were overlooked, or lacked the appropriate level of attention to ensure quality. All communication between the wait staff and the kitchen staff would filter through me so that interactions stayed calm and collected, ensuring guests received the best possible dining experience and that everyone on the team had a good time during their shift. After a few months I started taking extra shifts on the kitchen lines in addition to running the expedite station during dinner rushes. 
                  <br><br>
                  I learned a lot about restaurant operation both front of house and back during my time at Turner’s, including basic knife training for usage and maintenance, operating various sizes of ovens, steamers, fryers, broilers and open burners as well as warming tables and drawers for different types of hot and cold food holding. Turner’s also featured two alcohol serving bars in an otherwise dry town so the wait time for a table or even bar seat was substantial and so I learned to work in front of a crowded house on a daily basis (when expediting I was somewhat on display for the diners when calling out server names or verifying kitchen call outs), also becoming accustomed to proper guest relations and problem solving. I was on my way to having learned almost every station in the restaurant by the time I moved to California and left the job, having trained over a dozen other line cooks by the end of my second year. I was asked to stay with a pay increase but was determined to make a break for the west coast.

            BB&N Summer Day Camp, Cambridge MA<br>
            Group Counselor 	(06/2000)-(08/2004)<br><br>
            
            Summer day camp for kids, trained in their unpaid program to become a counselor at ages 11 and 12 and then once I was 13 started working summers there watching and interacting with groups of 15-20 children ages 6-12. Worked alongside one other group counselor each summer, which helped me develop a sense of responsibility and practiced skills needed to keep the kids both focused and entertained throughout the day. Worked for 8 weeks each summer from 8:15am to 5pm, was a fun job!
